Largest tracking error: case_015. Examine joint integer allocation and radius multiplier using public observed state, with all memories reevaluated and retained velocities fixed. Allocated fraction is allocated_count/swarm_size; the adapter encoding fraction only encodes an integer for the ceiling rule. Allocated counts are selected indices, not a claim of completed movement; horizon-truncated responses separately retain counts with objective queries. Constant count/radius pairs are permitted and receive no penalty for simplicity. Large interval-end errors indicate tracking still missed by the next change, while detection and memory shares expose objective-evaluation overhead. These diagnostics describe behavior and do not by themselves prove its cause. Improvements must preserve the fixed simulator and objective-evaluation budget. These are search results; generalization requires separate comparison cases.
